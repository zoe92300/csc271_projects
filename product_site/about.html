        <h2>Why Hobbies ?</h2>
        <p> <strong>Hobbies</strong> was born when I realised it was really hard to get condensed information about specifics hobbies. 
            It is sometimes necessary to navigate to several websites to get tutorials, budget, where to buy the material, and so on.
            Hobbies is a website that regroups all this information in one place. 
            It is then convenient for the user to find everything he/she needs to know for freshly starting a new hobby.
